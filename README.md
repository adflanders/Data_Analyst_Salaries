# Data_Analyst_Salaries
Looking at Data Analyst salaries using data analysis.

First started by finding 'Data Science Salaries 2023' on Kaggle.com,
where the creator of ds_salaries.csv scraped all data science related jobs
from https://ai-jobs.net/. Using SQL, I created a new table and file 'data_analysis_salaries.csv',
which pulled only job titles that had 'Data Analyst' in it or similar. After which I cleaned the data
and made it more compatible for Tableau, which allowed me to make a data visualization found at
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adam.flanders/viz/DataAnalystSalaries_16860053175510/Dashboard1.
All the queries I made and used are found in data_analytics.sql
